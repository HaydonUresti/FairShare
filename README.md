Hi, my name is Haydon! I'm a software engineering student. I build FairShare as my senior project in order to try out the MERN stack as well as develop my full-stack development skills. The idea of FairShare came to me as I thought about how I could improve how the educational experience for both students and educators. Groupwork can be frustrating for students as it does not always seem fair, though such is life. I think a lot of this percieved unfairness comes from the educator not being able to keep track of who does what or how students contribute. It would be difficult to stay on top of it all even if they really wanted to try. I developed FairShare to combat this issue. It is meant to deliver student and group information to educators in a helpful and efficient manner. Currenlty FairShare allows Educator users to create groups and tasks for Student users to join and do, and then delivers summaries of student and group progress on them. I consider this to be just a demo. I have a lot more ideas of things I would like to add such as features like group chats, grading helpers/measurements, and classes for groups, among many other things. There is also a lot of room for other improvments in things like styling, settings, and accessibility and I plan to continue making such improvments. Thank you for checking out FairShare!
